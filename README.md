## 3. how well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

### Salary Analysis for Data Jobs

#### visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6,x='salary_year_avg',y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

plt.title('Salary Distribution by Job Title in USA')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary')
plt.ylabel('')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos:f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
plt.xlim(0, 600000)

plt.show()
```

#### Results 

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in Jobs in the US](project\images\salarry_boxplot.png)
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 date job titles.*

#### Insights

From the analysis, it‚Äôs clear that salary levels follow a consistent hierarchy: **Data Analyst** sits at the bottom, while **Senior Data Scientist** leads with the highest pay. Median salaries show a big jump when moving from Analyst roles (~$70K‚Äì$130K) to Engineer/Scientist roles (~$130K‚Äì$170K), with Senior Data Scientist pushing even higher (~$150K‚Äì$180K).  

I also notice that Analysts have a much **narrower range**, which makes their salaries more predictable, but less rewarding. In contrast, Engineers and Scientists face **much wider spreads**, meaning opportunities for very high salaries exist, especially in top companies. The extreme outliers for Data Scientist and Data Engineer (reaching $500K‚Äì$600K) highlight how lucrative these roles can be in rare cases.  

Overall, the data shows that **moving from Analyst to Scientist/Engineer roles is the real game-changer** in terms of growth. Senior positions clearly pay more, but the Analyst-to-Scientist/Engineer jump offers the most dramatic salary boost. 

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

#### Visualize Data 

```python
# Top 10 highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.set_theme(style="ticks")
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median',y=df_DA_top_pay.index,ax=ax[0], hue='median',palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median',y=df_DA_skills.index,ax=ax[1],hue='median',palette='light:b')

plt.show()

```

#### Results

![The Highesst Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](project\images\The_Highesst_Paid_and_Most_In_Demand_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_US.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and mist in-ddemand skills for data analysts in the US.*


#### Insights

The charts reveal an interesting contrast between **highest paid skills** and **most in-demand skills** for Data Analysts.  

On the salary side, niche and specialized tools like **dplyr ($196K)**, **bitbucket ($189K)**, and **gitlab ($186K)** bring the highest pay, showing that rare technical expertise can significantly boost earnings. However, these skills are not the most widely required, which makes them lucrative but less common in the job market.  

On the demand side, core tools such as **Python ($97K)**, **SQL ($91K)**, and visualization platforms like **Tableau ($92K)** and **Power BI ($90K)** dominate. These are the practical must-have skills for most data analyst roles, but their median salaries are lower compared to the niche skills.  

Overall, the data suggests a clear trade-off:  
- **High demand skills** (Python, SQL, Tableau) secure more job opportunities but come with moderate pay.  
- **High paying skills** (dplyr, bitbucket, gitlab) are less common but can unlock exceptional salaries for those who master them.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I moved far beyond practicing code snippets and started to understand how data analysis works in practice.  
I learned how to approach problems step by step ‚Äî from cleaning raw datasets, to applying the right Python libraries, to creating visuals that actually communicate insights.  

I also discovered the difference between *just running analysis* and *telling a story with data*.  
This meant comparing job roles, exploring skill trends, and linking technical results back to real business implications.  

On the technical side, I became more confident with Python libraries like **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**, and with tools such as **Jupyter, Google Colab, Git, and GitHub**.  
On the analytical side, I developed the habit of asking better questions and structuring my work more clearly, so that each result leads logically to the next.
Overall, the biggest lesson was learning how to combine **technical skills** with **analytical thinking** to generate insights that are useful, not just correct.


# Overall Insights
- Success in data analysis comes from balancing **high-demand tools** (SQL, Excel, Tableau) with **high-value skills** (Python, advanced databases).
- Different roles (Analyst, Engineer, Scientist) require distinct skill mixes, which directly influence **salary** and **career trajectory**.
- Trends show traditional tools remain relevant, but **programming and cloud-oriented skills** are steadily becoming essential.
- The true edge is turning raw data into **clear, actionable insights** that drive real business impact.



# üìå Conclusion  
This project was more than just practicing Python ‚Äî it was about connecting technical skills to real-world questions.  
By exploring job roles, skill demand, salary trends, and optimal learning paths, I learned how to move from **raw data** to **meaningful insights**.  

The journey showed me that the real value of data analysis lies not only in writing code or making charts, but in **telling a story that supports decisions**.  
This is the mindset I‚Äôll carry forward into future projects and my career path in data.
